# Work to Show

# Website list 

These websites i have completely developed myself:
- www.chillidhaba.nz
- www.officecrew.nz

Perreaux is still in development and waiting on quite a few things. It will run slow for you currently because the server is only Singapore.

- Perreaux.heresy.co.nz

## Website briefs

### ChilliDhaba

Chilli Dhaba was actually my first website done within the current business I work for. I would have done the CSS a little bit differently, but I tried making more classes that can constantly be reused, which would save on overwritten CSS. Now I would have put the written content into a JSON file and iterate over it with the reused classes applied.

### Officecrew

Officecrew is another small website that I finished off building. I went through at the end of this project to tidy the code up. This project can hopefully give the clearest idea on how my code now generally looks like.

### Perreaux

Perreaux has gone through many redesigns, due to client reviews. This was the first website I worked on for T&D. There is actually so much i would improve with this. I wanted to show it to you out of how big this website is. I have attached some files so you can see some of my JS code in vue. This website is still in development so this has not had my code clean up yet! I will be renaming variables, making more components to break down the site, and then rewrite what i can, to make statments in their clearest form (along with their shortest). I'd love to talk more about it in the video call :)

# Code Challenges 

These code challenges were done in University, but thought it might be worth showing off to you. I would certainly format the code a lot more now and make variable names clearer. There are a few instances were code can be shortened. 

# Other Work 

The code in this repo is some work I thought you might be interested in looking at. If you want to see anymore I have a few public repositories. There is a shopping system written in Java that I did for 6 months in Uni, which could be an interesting look
